# Voronoi

Little side project that draws consecutives stages of the Voronoi diagram and saves them to jpg files, making it easy to create a gif out of it.
After seeing the [gif on the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#/media/File:Voronoi_growth_euclidean.gif), that showed drawing of the diagram by expanding circles around each point I knew I wanted to do it myself!


**Important notes**

Afaik the voronoi is drawn from points, but at the classes at my uni, we learned about voronoi next to simple pathfinding algorithms for robots & the Voronois there were made not from points, but from rectangles - this is what my project does.


**Usage**

There is no CLI, just drop whatever You need into the main.cpp file - there's a working example in there, but make sure to change the output path (also there).
