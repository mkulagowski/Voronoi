Voronoi

Little side project that draws consecutives stages of the Voronoi diagram and saves them to jpg files, making it easy to create a gif out of it.
After seeing the gif on the wiki, that showed drawing of the diagram by expanding circles around each point I knew I wanted to do it myself!

Afaik the voronoi is drawn from points, but at the classes at my uni, we learned about voronoi next to simple pathfinding algorithms for robots & the Voronois there were made not from points, but from rectangles - this is what my project does.

There is no CLI, just drop whatever You need into the main.cpp file - there's a working example in there, but make sure to change the output path (also there).
